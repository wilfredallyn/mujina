# mujina-miner

Open source Bitcoin mining software written in Rust for ASIC mining hardware.

> **Developer Preview**: This software is under heavy development and not ready
> for production use. The code is made available for developers interested in
> contributing, learning about Bitcoin mining protocols, or evaluating the
> architecture. APIs, protocols, and features are subject to change without
> notice. Documentation is incomplete and may be inaccurate. Use at your own

## Overview

mujina-miner is a modern, async Rust implementation of Bitcoin mining software
designed to communicate with various Bitcoin mining hash boards via USB serial
interfaces. It's part of the larger Mujina OS project, an open source,
Debian-based embedded Linux distribution optimized for Bitcoin mining hardware.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between transport, board control,
  chip communication, and mining logic
- **Async I/O**: Built on Tokio for efficient concurrent operations
- **Multi-Board Support**: Extensible design for different ASIC boards and chips
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Generic traits for GPIO, I2C, and ADC operations
- **Protocol Documentation**: Detailed documentation of mining protocols

### Protocol Documentation

- [BM13xx ASIC Protocol](mujina-miner/src/asic/bm13xx/PROTOCOL.md) - Serial
  protocol for BM13xx series mining chips
- [Bitaxe-Raw Control Protocol](mujina-miner/src/mgmt_protocol/bitaxe_raw/PROTOCOL.md) -
  Management protocol for Bitaxe board peripherals

### Hardware Documentation

- [Bitaxe Gamma Board Guide](mujina-miner/src/board/bitaxe_gamma.md) - Hardware
  and software interface documentation for Bitaxe Gamma

## Supported Hardware

Currently supported:
- **Bitaxe Gamma** with BM1370 ASIC (via bitaxe-raw firmware)

Planned support:
- **EmberOne** with BM1362 ASIC
- Additional Bitaxe variants
- Antminer hash boards
- Other ASIC mining hardware

## Build Requirements

### Development Dependencies (Linux)

On Debian/Ubuntu systems:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
```

The `libudev-dev` package provides header files and development libraries
required for USB device discovery during compilation.

### macOS

macOS support is planned but not yet implemented. USB discovery will use the
IOKit framework when available.

## Building

```bash
# Build the workspace
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run the miner daemon (requires connected hardware)
cargo run --bin mujina-minerd
```

## Running

Ensure your Bitaxe device is connected via USB and appears as `/dev/ttyACM0`
and `/dev/ttyACM1`.

```bash
# Run with default logging
cargo run --bin mujina-minerd

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=mujina_miner=debug cargo run --bin mujina-minerd

# Run with trace logging (shows all serial communication)
RUST_LOG=mujina_miner=trace cargo run --bin mujina-minerd
```

## Protocol Analysis Tool

The `mujina-dissect` tool analyzes captured communication between the host and
mining hardware, providing detailed protocol-level insights for BM13xx serial
commands and PMBus/I2C power management operations.

See [tools/mujina-dissect/README.md](tools/mujina-dissect/README.md) for
detailed usage and documentation.
