//! USB transport implementation.
//!
//! This module handles USB device discovery and hotplug events.
//! It provides raw device information without any knowledge of
//! what the devices are or how they should be configured.
//!
//! ## Platform Support
//!
//! - **Linux**: Uses udev for device enumeration and hotplug monitoring
//! - **macOS**: Stub implementation (IOKit support planned for future)

    ///
    /// # Architecture
    ///
    /// USB monitoring runs in a dedicated OS thread rather than an async task
    /// because the underlying udev C library provides no thread-safety guarantees.
    /// The udev types contain raw C pointers that are !Send, meaning they cannot
    /// safely cross thread boundaries. By running the monitor in a dedicated
    /// thread, we:
    ///
    /// 1. Keep udev objects confined to a single OS thread (as libudev requires)
    /// 2. Use the simpler synchronous udev API (no async overhead)
    /// 3. Extract device info into Send types before sending via channels
    /// 4. Allow the main async runtime to spawn this without Send constraints
    ///
    /// The thread monitors the udev socket (a file descriptor) using blocking I/O,
    /// which is efficient for infrequent hotplug events. The overhead of one
    /// dedicated thread is negligible compared to the complexity of trying to
    /// make udev work with Tokio's multi-threaded work-stealing scheduler.
    ///
    /// # Shutdown
    ///
    /// The monitoring thread checks the provided `CancellationToken` and exits
    /// gracefully when cancellation is requested.
    pub async fn start_discovery(&self, shutdown: CancellationToken) -> Result<()> {
        // Create platform-specific discovery implementation

/// udev's raw C pointers. The synchronous API is used since USB hotplug events
/// are infrequent and don't benefit from async overhead.
